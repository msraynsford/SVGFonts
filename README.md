# SVGFonts
SVG fonts are very handy for laser cutting because they can be used to create outlines of letters instead of filled shapes. These can be laser cut much faster than standard fonts and look neater. Here is a growing collection of fonts I've created for my own projects.

#DEPNorse

![DEP Norse Example](/DEPNorse.png)

This font was used in [Loki's box of tricks](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/msraynsford/lokis-box-of-tricks), it's a constant width font designed to look like a runic alphabet

# DEPGreek

![DEP Greek Example](/DEPGreek.png)

This font was used in [The Antikythera Tablets](https://www.donteatpuzzles.com/tablets), it's a simple conversion to English (aplha = 'a') and some liberties taken with the missing characters.


# DEPSemaphore

![DEP Semaphore Example](/DEPSemaphore.png)

A stick version of [Flag Semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore), it's easily recognised and a great way to make a simple code

# DEPSemaphoreClock

![DEP Semaphore Clock Example](/DEPSemaphoreClock.png)

A simplified version of [Flag Semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_semaphore), inspired by [Enigmailed](https://enigmailed.com/), this version has a ring around the outside to look like a clock face.
